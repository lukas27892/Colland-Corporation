## Hello there,

Ever since we started this project, we built from the ground up until we starting to design and polish facilities.

### Can we get in contact with socials?

Yes, (im bored to put more socials so yeah) [Colland Corporation Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KkKwYrdaYK)

### What is this corporation?

This corporation mainly uses electricity, while electricity causes more deaths then radiation, It's better to be gaining shocks rather then not noticing radiation. (totally honest lol)

Want to know behind the scenes, here are things we use to help construct games.

# Scripts
Datastore
These are used to store Credits which is a upcoming feature.

Events
We script events so they happen if a certain thing occurs.


# Values
Values are used to determine what it does.
e.g: 1 = Enable, 0 = Disabled
We use the number type value which is used for the temp.

# Lighting

Thanks to roblox for introducing the future lighting, the lighting will be better then ever and increase realism.
